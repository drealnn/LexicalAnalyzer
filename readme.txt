To compile, ensure that the files scanner.c vector.c and vector.h are in the same directory.
Run gcc on both vector.c and scanner.c and output as desired.
i.e.)  gcc scanner.c vector.c -o lex
After running the output file, cleaninput.txt lexemelist.txt and lexemetable.txt will be generated in the same directory.
The files for an example run have been included.
